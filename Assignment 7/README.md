## Design

We first started this assignment by understanding how the flow of the code should go. Verneshia started off by adding the provided skeleton code and modifying the default constructor, add, subtract, color object conversion, and string print functions in the skeleton. 

We proceeded to write down the steps or the algorithm to relieve the difficulties in coding. The steps were relatively simple to follow and there were very few challenges. The focus was more on user experience rather than efficiency. This is beneficial for the user as they are given options throughout the program. If a user enters an incorrect input, they will be asked to try again

The user is given two options in the beginning: if they would like to enter the color by name or by RGB code. For the name option, the name of the color must be from the list of options that have been created in the dictionary, otherwise, the program will recognize a bad input and will ask the user to try again. Once the user chooses two color names, the program will display the resulting keys (a string of color names) of the two colors added and the two colors subtracted. The values are retrieved from the Colors class and passed back into two different color objects. From then there the respective operation is done and the results are converted into a tuple to search for the respective result color to display. 

A similar process is done for the RGB code option. The user is asked to input the values that they would like to enter. The enter must enter the values in the format declared in the instructions for the program to work. Users may enter a decimal value for inputs. If the calculation results match a color key in the dictionary, the color name will display, if not, the answer will still be calculated and displayed. The algorithm is implemented in the same way. Initially, the user could input the values individually, however, we decided on fewer user inputs in order to successfully complete the task in a better way. 


## Coding 

The coding was mostly implemented by Verneshia. All of the necessary program logic was implemented by her. Sharmada contributed to some of the user inputs but mainly worked on the documentation. Please refer to the .py file for the code. 

## Documentation

All documentation has been done by Sharmada Iyer. 

## Testing

Debugging was done throughout the creation of the code. The code was also tested at the end to ensure there were not any errors or bugs. There were indentation errors that have been fixed. Screenshots of the results are provided in the zipped file.
